## (this read me is not final and will be updated as required to meet the standards of the actual game)

### Overview

Escape Protocol is a fast-paced survival shooter where players must navigate a multi-story building overrun with monsters. The objective is to clear enemies, reach the rooftop, and escape via helicopter before time runs out.

### Story

The game starts with David waking up on the upper floor of a mysterious building. His head is pounding, and he doesnâ€™t remember how he got there. Suddenly, a voice crackles through his earpiece:

* John: "David, can you hear me, David?" (shouting)
* David: "What's up, John?" (groggy, disoriented)
* John: "Good, you're still alive."
* John: "The building you're in is about to be blown up. Grab your gun and get out of there!"

David must act quickly to escape before the timer hits zero.

### Gameplay Features
